## Critical Paths to Update

### Python Files Writing to knowledge/

These files need to be updated to use `KNOWLEDGE_ROOT` instead of `PROJECT_ROOT / "knowledge"`:

```bash
# Find all files that write to knowledge/ paths
grep -r "knowledge/signals\|knowledge/content" execution/ -l
```

**Files identified** (35 Python files):
- All scripts in `execution/agents/`
- All scripts in `execution/workflows/`
- All scripts in `execution/parsers/`
- All scripts in `execution/system/`
- All scripts in `execution/ops/`

**Update Required**:
```python
# Before
from libs.core_config import PROJECT_ROOT
signal_path = PROJECT_ROOT / "knowledge/signals/file.md"

# After
from libs.core_config import KNOWLEDGE_ROOT
signal_path = KNOWLEDGE_ROOT / "signals/file.md"
```
